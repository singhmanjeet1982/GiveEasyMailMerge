# GiveEasyMailMerge
Project is created using .Net Core 3.0  
No third party components are used for MailMerge.  
Interop Word library is used for reading word 'dotx' template.  

SMTP configuration need to be entered in 'appsettings' file for email to work.  
Files are generated in upload folder inside the project after mail merge and deleted after sending email or in case of any error(Deleted in Finally)  
Sample dotx and csv file is included as part of project.  
I will be happy to give a call to discuss this project.
